YouTube API - ELT Pipeline
This project builds an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) data pipeline using the YouTube API, orchestrated with Apache Airflow and containerized with Docker.

This project extracts data from the YouTube API, loads it into a PostgreSQL database, and applies transformations to prepare it for analysis. The pipeline includes data quality testing and CI/CD practices.
